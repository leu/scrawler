# tif
tif is the name of this keyboard

it is a contrived reference to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LMr5XTgeyI, which is by the youtuber that made the video that inspired this keyboard, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=thOifuHs6eY

this repo contains all my notes, pcb designs, and cad files for 3d print for the tif keyboard
