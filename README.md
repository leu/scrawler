# scrawler
the scrawler is the name of this keyboard

this repo contains all my notes, pcb designs, and cad files for 3d print for the scrawler

to do:

put MPU somewhere else

keep low profile

simple case

thumbs on side

wireless

![prototype left side](notes/prototype/IMG_20210712_093350.jpg)
![prototype right side](notes/prototype/IMG_20210712_093407.jpg)
![prototype both sides](notes/prototype/IMG_20210712_093523.jpg)

for side thumbs:

more comfortable

against side thumbs:

harder to make case

high profile (but mpu would fit)
